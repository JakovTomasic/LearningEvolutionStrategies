# First setup:

- install `swig` application on your device (needed or you will end up with [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51811263/problems-pip-installing-box2d) error).
- create python environment `python -m venv .venv`
- run python environment stored in .venv
- while you are in your active .venv run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# To run every time:

- run python environment stored in .venv
- do stuff...
- deactivate by just running `deactivate`. The documentation says: "Once you have finished working on your project, itâ€™s a good habit to deactivate its venv. Without deactivating your venv, all other Python code you execute, even if it is outside your project directory, will also run inside the venv."
